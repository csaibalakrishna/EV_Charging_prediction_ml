🚗 EV Demand Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project focuses on predicting the future demand for Electric Vehicles (EVs) using real-world data and machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze patterns in historical EV usage and infrastructure data to forecast upcoming demand, aiding stakeholders in sustainable transportation planning and investment.

📌 Project Overview
The electric vehicle industry is growing rapidly due to increasing environmental concerns and supportive government policies. Accurate demand forecasting can help manufacturers, governments, and infrastructure providers make informed decisions.

This project:

Uses a real-world dataset provided during a technical program.

Applies machine learning to forecast EV demand.

Emphasizes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and result visualization.
✅ Tasks Completed (Week 1)
✅ Dataset received from organization

✅ Removed null values and handled missing data

✅ Detected and removed outliers

✅ Performed basic statistical analysis (mean, std, correlation)

✅ Exploratory Data Analysis initiated

📈 Visualizations planned with seaborn and matplotlib

🔧 Tech Stack
Language: Python 3.x

Libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn

ML Model: Random Forest Regressor (baseline)
